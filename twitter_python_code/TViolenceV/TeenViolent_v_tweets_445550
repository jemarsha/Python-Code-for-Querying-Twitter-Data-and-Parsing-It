@HeathStevens69 Just to be clear - I'm talking about which BPUs are where in various maps and modes, and not about how the BPU itself works.
@grahamalondis It is a possibility.....we're sort of limited with the center point, but we could possibly change some of the others.
@soh20 Good stuff, thanks.
@ZoupGaming I'm talking more about general balance issues and not so much individual preferences.
@ZoupGaming Every pilot hates the stingers. Meanwhile, I've seen pilots that can stay alive for an entire game on maps like Desert or Glades
What're peoples biggest complaints about Battle pickups in various maps and modes? Location, selection, whatever....

Some cops will shoot anybody, some cops won't shoot anybody, no matter how much they need shooting....
