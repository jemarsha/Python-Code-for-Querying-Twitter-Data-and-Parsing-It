This week is kicking my ass.
Final papers got me fucked up.

@SinisterAvery yeah but we'll be BETTER
@SinisterAvery any day now! I'll be in your band
@TyleKurner that's all I needed to hear üòå
@TyleKurner rare
RT @TheFilmStage: 2001: A Space Odyssey // Interstellar http://t.co/A5dvQZYCYs
@mattfasullo that's you always.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro Matt that's probably the dumbest thing you've ever said.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro are the sounds of birds singing not music? Or the flowing of a gentle stream? Nature's music always surrounds us.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro I credit the dangerous summer and Mother Nature, not Cody.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro I didn't need to. That doesn't make me an idiot. You idiot.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro you're right Cody, thank you for reminding me of them, but how does that make me an idiot? Explain that please.
@omurulaije stay strong ‚úäüèª
Enjoying this beautiful weather. http://t.co/UMAgwjI1tl
Days like today remind me of The Dangerous Summer and how much I miss their music.

@agoraoptera @QXZenith @jackalsworth WORDS THAT KILL
@Sicon112 @jackalsworth You'd think Jack would be used to it by now, considering the TWWF community.
@AzureFey Appendix dominating death, you say?
@agoraoptera @eli_gone_crazy agora no
@eli_gone_crazy @agoraoptera I do believe that's the first time I've seen you call him that in over a year.  @_@
@eli_gone_crazy @jackalsworth @agoraoptera @QXZenith somehow I don't think that qualifies as a "gift"
@agoraoptera @jackalsworth @QXZenith @eli_gone_crazy *gasp* language, sir
@agoraoptera @IgnoreTheInsane @QXZenith @eli_gone_crazy @jackalsworth oh snap
@agoraoptera @eli_gone_crazy @IgnoreTheInsane @QXZenith we could always do that one quest we never finished, krika
@agoraoptera @QXZenith @eli_gone_crazy @_@
@eli_gone_crazy @QXZenith that is decidedly untrue, and how dare you say that
@IgnoreTheInsane @QXZenith *gives Qara a good-luck hug*
@agoraoptera @QXZenith @eli_gone_crazy agora you're scaring me again
@neilyourself what have you done
@SignBeetle @eli_gone_crazy Looked like an awful lot of cabbage butterflies to me at first.
@RyanJohnNelson @thelindsayellis ...what the shit.
