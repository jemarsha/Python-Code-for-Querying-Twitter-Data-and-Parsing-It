@tut5150 @Anomaly100 You don't dictate to me what I say. When you can't accept reality, you don't deserve an intelligent discord.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 Too bad he isnt real LOL
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 You are STUPID. Anytime you are presented with fact, garbled nonsense is your response. I wish Christ would rapture you
Love when a fuck Christian says "Oh well explain the science to me, then!" - no. You go learn it yourself, then come back.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 You're the one who believes in god. Also, youre so stupid, I now hate you
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 Asserting a Gods existence because you don't understand something is a weak argument. Very basic and child-like.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 If you want to pay me $70,000 a year to teach you science, I'll be happy to. Its not my responsibility to educate you.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 Yeah use logic on me you goddamn idiot. You believe a snake talked, the earth is 6000 years old and God hates foreskins
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 I am mad that dumb people like you believe in fairy tales that a 5 year old can figure out is fake.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 I'm not as good at it as Jesus. He's still trolling you
Troll a Christian every day of your life. Make this shit embarrassing to believe in.
@Anomaly100 @tut5150 I hate that lazy, rape condoning, contradiction giving genocidal motherfucker too
Someone just told me he believes in God because he spoke in tongues once.  I told him it was like dancing - a spontaneous stupid group "act"
Imagine reading a book with all the words in one giant paragraph. Now, apply that to your super long facebook posts.
What is crazy isn't that. It's where I'm from. An inbred hillbilly fuck town.
I had a genius IQ at 8.

@SethMacFarlane Hey my church was wondering if you could help us figure out what "Unconditional" meant. http://t.co/UBjA2ZtHwb
