@tut5150 @Anomaly100 You don't dictate to me what I say. When you can't accept reality, you don't deserve an intelligent discord.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 Too bad he isnt real LOL
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 You are STUPID. Anytime you are presented with fact, garbled nonsense is your response. I wish Christ would rapture you
Love when a fuck Christian says "Oh well explain the science to me, then!" - no. You go learn it yourself, then come back.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 You're the one who believes in god. Also, youre so stupid, I now hate you
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 Asserting a Gods existence because you don't understand something is a weak argument. Very basic and child-like.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 If you want to pay me $70,000 a year to teach you science, I'll be happy to. Its not my responsibility to educate you.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 Yeah use logic on me you goddamn idiot. You believe a snake talked, the earth is 6000 years old and God hates foreskins
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 I am mad that dumb people like you believe in fairy tales that a 5 year old can figure out is fake.
@tut5150 @Anomaly100 I'm not as good at it as Jesus. He's still trolling you
Troll a Christian every day of your life. Make this shit embarrassing to believe in.
@Anomaly100 @tut5150 I hate that lazy, rape condoning, contradiction giving genocidal motherfucker too
Someone just told me he believes in God because he spoke in tongues once.  I told him it was like dancing - a spontaneous stupid group "act"
Imagine reading a book with all the words in one giant paragraph. Now, apply that to your super long facebook posts.
What is crazy isn't that. It's where I'm from. An inbred hillbilly fuck town.
I had a genius IQ at 8.
Review: Goosebumps – Attack of the Mutant Part 2 http://t.co/42gMxNBR3Q
@PlatoQuotess_ I read that and it pissed me off, it was so made up
@SethMacFarlane Hey my church was wondering if you could help us figure out what "Unconditional" meant. http://t.co/UBjA2ZtHwb
@JanineJusbeecuz Yeah, it's harassing me to be saved something worse than a Christian pastor.
@quailing ha! Congrats, you rabid reader, you! :)
@FishWife7 *with extra butter and cheese*
Man, you guys are getting worked up.
I don't like tj, but I truly hope he's ok.
The Song made an appearance in my dream last night. And I haven't even heard it. What is he doing to us? Lol
One of my high school classmates just named her new baby Amyrikal. *rolls eyes*
Perfect!! Lol“@quailing: lol I'm going to start using this https://t.co/6GhWNhPIQm”
@FishWife7 congratulations!! And I hope you find some good ones! (With better luck than you and I had :)
@FishWife7 that does suck. But maybe the zombie apocalypse will happen before she has to pay it. ;)
@Teal_Deer *applause*
@quailing my husband leaves the room when I turn it on. You people with consciences...lol
@_mamadeb yeah, there are lots of similarities.
@FishWife7 are you so happy she's not TOO far away, though?! I worry mine will go to Europe or something...
@quailing I take it you're not a Walking Dead fan? Lol
Oh! I forgot to brag--my two oldest had their peep dioramas chosen for the online Washington Post! They're so excited.
Staying home with kids is bizarre. It's like you have no opportunity to do anything requiring thought, but you're constantly warring boredom
And now you're up to date. Exciting life, no? Lol
Also, I had an Adam binge on Pinterest last night. So many cute older pictures I hadn't seen! He really does deserve all the good things.
I wanted to hate The Magicians because so much of the initial storyline seemed derivative, but I've been won over. I love the descriptions.
Now I'm reading Two Boys Kissing and The Magicians (no, i never read just one book) and am enjoying them very much.
