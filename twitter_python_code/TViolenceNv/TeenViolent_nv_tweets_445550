@Tommy_Hiddles -the baby is okay. I won't take any risks if I can help it.
@Tommy_Hiddles I don't think so. Henry was okay and I was both forms with him. If I start feeling really weird I'll switch back so I'm sure-
@Tommy_Hiddles *shrugs* I guess it's easier to deal with being sick in my natural form? Do you want me to switch back?
@Tommy_Hiddles *my head shakes slightly* Other than this, just holding me, not really Loon. Hopefully it won't last too long.
@Tommy_Hiddles I even chuckle when you kiss me once more* We're okay, for the moment. I'm getting morning sickness with this little one
@Tommy_Hiddles *My eyes close slowly when you kiss around my face. I grin when your hand moves down my chest and comes to rest on my stomach
@Tommy_Hiddles *my hand rubs your back comfortingly as I gently shush you* I missed you too sweetheart, but its okay. I'm here now.
I've missed you too Loon. I'm glad you like my pic.
*pulls @Tommy_Hiddles against me tightly and moans into the kiss*
RT @Fuck_ThePerfect: When I fell for you, I fell hard.
@HelaUnchained It's my pleasure to have him visit. He's a wonderful boy. You are all welcome in my home Hela.
