I think Donkey Kong is my second favorite Nintendo series. As much as I love Zelda and Metroid I think the DK games are so much fun!
Bloodborne is not as hard as people make it out to be. Like just don't rush fights and you'll be fine. Spend time leveling up early on.
Never get between a Kong and his banana hoard. #nintendo #donkeykong #diddykong #donkeykongcountry https://t.co/8naJpLzd6P
