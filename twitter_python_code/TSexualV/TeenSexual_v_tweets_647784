@tokaikko OMG fuck those canadians for nit sharing
Zoe and sarah shahi 10 octaves lower than usual shaw voice should just speak to each other with their voices for a whole episode

WORLD RENOWNED GIFFED AUTHOR AND POI-CAST MENTIONING TUMBLR USER ALETHIA-NORMANDY should 100% be my bio
Uggghh can't sleep, to live watch or nay
RT @TheMattFowler: Tonight‚Äôs #PersonOfInterest is superb/devastating/not what you think.
Alright I'm going to bed, I'm definitely going to stay up and live watch the next two eps but I think this one can wait till the morning üò¥
@biggieslow omfg your icon üòÇ
@biggieslow If Control or Martine dies I will actually have emotional reactions and we're supposed to hate them I don't even...
The wait is killing me I just want the last 2 episodes now. As much as I'm looking forward to seeing Carter. The main plot is everything.
RT @hvdley: @AletheiaSR1 it would be heavy but overall not that impactful to just be reoccurrings, no way every regular is making it out
RT @Jaio_Liu: @AletheiaSR1 really think there's a regular in it...
Still my point remains, there is no way there are just guest stars dying here.
and they said we were losing 5...sorry but I can't imagine them chopping FIVE guest stars in one episode...
People who are in the finale and could die:

Regular: Fusco, Reese, Root, Finch.

Guest: Control, Elias, Dominic, Martine, Iris or Grice.
and that Amy mentioned losing guest stars or something to that effect. So...
