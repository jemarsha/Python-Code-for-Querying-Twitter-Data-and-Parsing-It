Oops. Thongs spotted in the Qantas Business Club!!!
Never mind thongs in the Qantas Club. I'd vote for the abolishment of pyjama-wearing adults in flight. #yourenotinbed #flightclothes
"Thank you sir."  "Thanks man." Which was used to a black man disembarking, and which to the white man in front of him? @Qantas #QF22
#qantasclub vs JAL #sakuraclub #Tokyo: clientele far more casual and noisy. Seems thongs and singlets ban only barely raised the standard.

Tonight I'm going to have some beer. At Publika's Bar Fly. Come join me as I drink alcohol and talk to pretty girls!
Thinking about her makes me sad. Thinking about her kiss makes it even worse, she has soft lips, the first time we kissed was the best.
