@mattfasullo that's you always.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro Matt that's probably the dumbest thing you've ever said.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro are the sounds of birds singing not music? Or the flowing of a gentle stream? Nature's music always surrounds us.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro I credit the dangerous summer and Mother Nature, not Cody.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro I didn't need to. That doesn't make me an idiot. You idiot.
@mattfasullo @codynicastro you're right Cody, thank you for reminding me of them, but how does that make me an idiot? Explain that please.
@omurulaije stay strong ‚úäüèª
Enjoying this beautiful weather. http://t.co/UMAgwjI1tl
Days like today remind me of The Dangerous Summer and how much I miss their music.
