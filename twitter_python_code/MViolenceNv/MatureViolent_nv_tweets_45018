@GamingFTL shit I'll have to buy facepaint or else the illusion is ruined
@GamingFTL MEEEEEEEEE
Hey, email me news about your game: joe@destructoid.com
@HurdyIV I always liked collecting Pokemon more than battling with them.
*sigh* Guess I'm buying a New 3DS when I've got a bit more money.
@BenKuchera When I read the news about it, I was hoping it was closer to the Sonic 2 HD project that got canned, but this is good too.
@BenKuchera Ben you're really not making this decision any easier for me :P. The Sonic 1 remake looks so pretty!
Ok it looks like it's just an upscaled version of the original Sonic 2 with 3D parralax. Ehhhhhhhhhhhh
Please for all that is holy, let this be an actual remake or jazzing up and not a rushed 3D job. I'd buy a 3DS for a Sonic 2 remake.
@_JakeTucker @adtidixon @lexicobob :) My job is to ruin peoples' free time.
WAIT HOLD ON. When they say they're remastering Sonic 2 for 3DS... do they mean like a proper 3D remake or something disappointing?
Just played the first level of Neon Struct and all I can say is "Oh my stars and garters YES".

Nice job, @dphrygian. Nice freakin' job.
