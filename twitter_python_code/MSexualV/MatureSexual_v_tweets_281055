So much butt hurt going on for college acceptances and rejections. I feel awful for not completing my B.A./M.A  at UCB. Lol
@_ManjotA You need to surround yourself with better people. It'll mean less friends but it'll be for the better.

@smellslikealex one of my all time favorite shows ever!
@smellslikealex yea I finished it when they released the last chapter of the manga. It was fucking amazing!
@smellslikealex the show is very long and the story itself is very good. Rock Lee is hilarious and always proves to be badass.
@smellslikealex brush brows is pretty badass. He's my third favorite of all of the characters. Have you finished the show yet?
@smellslikealex that part amazed me when they it showed for the first time on Toonami!
