@gillianterzis lol no. It's such a bad shirt. But it would have been great to just rock up to work non-chalantly in it one day

@davidadonaldson $420 is such a lol amount of cash
@kemal_atlay @davidadonaldson this whole thing could have been avoided if the govt just released the business case tho. So whatever
@derrick_krusche yeah he's a total fraud
@davidadonaldson plus we'd only get back 40c to the dollar in economic return so ~ pretty sketchy ~
@davidadonaldson but would have cost $10.7bn ($4bn more than advertised) after $2b outlay, $1b close and $7.7b in yearly service payments
@Picketer yeah that's what I thought. Of course huge market share results in abnormal profits. The arguments are bunk
@Picketer Argument seems to be going that company tax burden too high compared to OECD. Dunno about feasibility of moving corps offshore tho

@brickonator I predict newspeak but yeah
@brickonator eeeeh, sorta
we don't really use straight up neologisms rather just force English words in because it's cool and memetic
the incessant urge for buzzwords will destroy the English language
